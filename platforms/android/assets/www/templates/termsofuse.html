    <h4 ng-style="{'text-align':'center'}">Terms of Use</h4>

    These terms ("Terms") cover the use of FitMK’s apps. By providing the opportunity of subscribing to, using and/or ordering the Services, FitMK makes an offer to you. You accept these Terms by creating a FitMK account, by using the Services, or by continuing to use the Services after being notified of a change to these Terms. Please read, print and save a copy of these Terms for your records because FitMK won’t save a copy for you.



    <h4>Your Privacy</h4>

    1. Your Privacy. Your privacy is important to us. Please read the FitMK Privacy Statement, the FitMK Health Privacy Statement as this describes the types of data we collect from you and your devices ("Data") and how we use your Data. The Privacy Statement also describes how FitMK uses your content, which is your communications with others; postings or feedback submitted by you to FitMK via the Services and the files, photos, documents, audio, digital works and videos that you upload, store or share through the Services ("Your Content"). By using the Services or agreeing to these Terms, you consent to FitMK's collection, use and disclosure of Your Content and Data as described in the Privacy Statement.

    <h4>Your Content</h4>

    2. Your Content. Many of our Services allow you to store or share Your Content or receive material from others. We don’t claim ownership of Your Content. Your Content remains Your Content and you are responsible for it.

    a. When you share Your Content with other people, you expressly agree that anyone you’ve shared Your Content with may, for free and worldwide, use, save, record, reproduce, transmit, display, communicate Your Content. If you do not want others to have that ability, do not use the Services to share Your Content. You represent and warrant that for the duration of these Terms you have (and will have) all the rights necessary for Your Content that is uploaded, stored or shared on or through the Services and that the collection, use and retention of Your Content through the Services won't violate any law or rights of others. We strongly advise you to make regular back-up copies of Your Content. FitMK can't be held responsible for Your Content or the material others upload, store or share using our Services.

    b. To the extent necessary to provide the Services to you and others (which may include changing the size, shape or format of Your Content to better store or display it to you), to protect you and the Services and to improve FitMK products and services, you grant FitMK a worldwide and royalty free intellectual property licence to use Your Content, for example, to make copies of, retain, transmit, reformat, distribute via communication tools and display Your Content on the Services. If you publish Your Content in areas of the Service where it is rendered available online publicly or without restrictions, Your Content may appear in demonstrations or materials that promote the Service. Some of the Services are supported by advertising. Controls for how FitMK personalises advertising are available on the Security & privacy page of the FitMK account management website. We do not use what you say in email, chat, video calls or voicemail, or your documents, photos or other personal files to target advertising to you. Our advertising policies are covered in detail in the Privacy Statements.

    <h4>Code of Conduct</h4>

    3. Code of Conduct.

    i. Don’t do anything illegal.

    ii. Don’t engage in any activity that exploits, harms or threatens to harm children.

    iii. Don’t send spam. Spam is unwanted or unsolicited bulk email, postings, contact requests, SMS (text messages) or instant messages.

    iv. Don’t publicly display or use the Services to share any inappropriate Content or other material (involving, for example, nudity, bestiality, pornography, graphic violence or criminal activity).

    v. Don’t engage in activity that is false or misleading (e.g. asking for money under false pretenses, impersonating someone else, manipulating the Services to increase statistics, or affect rankings, ratings or comments).

    vi. Don’t willfully circumvent any restrictions on access to or availability of the Services.

    vii. Don’t engage in activity that is harmful to you, the Services or others (e.g. transmitting viruses, stalking, communicating hate speech or advocating violence against others).

    viii. Don’t infringe upon the rights of others (e.g, unauthorised sharing of copyrighted music or other copyrighted material, resale or other distribution of maps or photographs).

    ix. Don’t engage in activity that violates the privacy of others.

    x. Don’t help others break these rules.

    b. Enforcement. We reserve the right to deny Your Content if it exceeds limits on storage or file size allowed by the Service. In addition, if you violate any of the obligations listed in section 3(a) above or otherwise materially violate these Terms, we may take action against you including (without limitation) stopping providing Services or closing your FitMK account immediately for good cause or blocking delivery of a communication (like email or instant message) to or from the Services. We also reserve the right to remove or block Your Content from the Services at any time if it is brought to our attention that it may violate applicable law or these Terms. When investigating alleged violations of these Terms, FitMK reserves the right to review Your Content in order to resolve the issue. However, we do not monitor the Services and make no attempt to do so.

    <h4>Using the Services & Support</h4>

    4. Using the Services & Support.

    a. FitMK account. You’ll need a FitMK account to access many of the Services. Your FitMK account lets you sign in to apps, sessions, websites and services provided by FitMK.

    i. Creating an Account. You can create an account in app. You agree not to use any false, inaccurate or misleading information when signing up for your account. To protect your account, keep your account details and password confidential. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your FitMK account.

    ii. Account Use. If you are having trouble accessing your FitMK account, please visit this website (https://www.fitmk.com).

    iii. Kids and Accounts. By signing up, you represent that you have either reached the age of "majority" where you live or have valid parent or legal guardian consent to be bound by these Terms.  If you do not know whether you have reached the age of majority where you live, or do not understand this section, please do not create a FitMK account before you have asked your parent or legal guardian for help. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor that creates a FitMK account, you accept these Terms on the minor’s behalf and are responsible for supervising your minor child in the use of the FitMK account, or Services, including purchases, whether the minor’s account is now open or created later.

    <h4>Service Availability</h4>

    6. Service Availability.

    a. The Services offered through the Services may be unavailable from time to time, may be offered on a limited basis, or may vary depending on your region or device. If you change the location associated with your FitMK account, you may need to re-acquire material or applications that were available to you and paid for in your previous region.

    b. We strive to keep the Services up and running; however, all online services suffer occasional disruptions and outages. In the event of an outage or disruption to the Service, you may not be able to retrieve Your Content. We recommend that you regularly backup Your Content that you store on the Services or store using Third-Party Apps and Services.

    <h4>Updates to the Services or Software, and Changes to These Terms</h4>

    7. Updates to the Services or Software and Changes to These Terms.

    a. We'll inform you if we intend to change these Terms. We may change these Terms if it is necessary due to (i) applicable law, including, but not limited to, a change of such law; (ii) an advice and/or order based on applicable law; (iii) the evolution of the Services; (iv) technical reasons; (v) operational requirements or (vi) an advantageous change of terms for the user. We'll inform you of the intended change before it takes effect, either through the user interface, in an email message or through other reasonable means. Using the Services after the changes become effective means you agree to the new terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you must stop using the Services and close your FitMK account in accordance with section 4(a)(iv). We'll also expressly point to this fact when informing you about the intended change of these Terms.
